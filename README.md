# Data-warehouse-sql-project
📌 Overview

-This project implements a Data Warehouse using Microsoft SQL Server.
-It is designed to support analytical reporting and business intelligence by integrating data from multiple sources into a central repository.

-The warehouse follows a star schema approach, separating fact tables (measurable business data) from dimension tables (descriptive context).

🎯 Objectives

- Consolidate data from multiple operational databases.

- Enable efficient querying and analysis.

- Support dashboards and reporting tools (e.g., Power BI, SSRS).

- Improve decision-making through historical and trend analysis.

🏗️ Architecture

- ETL Process: Data is extracted from source systems, transformed (cleaned, standardized, aggregated), and loaded into the warehouse.

- Data Storage: Fact and dimension tables stored in SQL Server.

- Reporting Layer: Can be connected to BI tools for visualization.
